# VariousUnityTools
This project consists of various Unity tools that I like to use across my projects, mostly just a single place for me to hold them, I have these wrapped in singletons that only require the script to be on a game object in scene

## Tools included
- Timer tool
  - This currently adds timers that the any script can test against
  - TODO: Make the timer send out events when the timer is done
- On screen debugger
  - This currently logs output to a canvas on the screen
  - Dependent on Text Mesh Pro unity plugin
